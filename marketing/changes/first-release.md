### A new plugin: marketing, Brevo first

- **The gateway's marketing records as Brevo events** on the user's contact (feature `brevo`): the method as the event name, the record's own properties (status, duration, surface, route, UTM, referrer), the org and the consent on the contact. Choose with `send` (mutations, queries, all, off), `include` and `exclude`.
- **Contacts follow the auth plugin's accounts:** created on `UserCreated`, updated on `UserUpdated`, the consent attribute from `MarketingConsentChanged`, deleted with their history on `UserDeleted`.
- **Sent once:** a record is remembered as sent after Brevo accepted it (`SentEvent`), so a redelivered batch is not a second event. Requests are paced to `brevo_rps`, and a 429 is waited out.
- Needs w17 platform 1.13 and an `auth` activation in the same domain.
