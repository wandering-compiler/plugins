## 0.1.0-rc.17

### Module path

The Go module path changed from `github.com/wandering-compiler/platform/plugins/<name>` to `github.com/wandering-compiler/plugins/<name>`, matching the repository the plugin now lives in.

- Generated code needs nothing. `w17ctl plugin update` re-vendors the plugin, and codegen rewrites the imports from the manifest's `go_module`.
- Hand-written code that imports the plugin's packages directly (a `lib/…` package, say) must change its import paths. It must also change any `replace` directive in its own `go.mod` that names the old module path.

No behaviour change since 0.1.0-rc.16. This release carries the module path and comment edits only.
